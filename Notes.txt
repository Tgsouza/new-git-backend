Setting up terminal.
First open the terminal on VScode, go to the + sign on the terminal and select the git bash.
The command pallete have already been changed so that every time we use the terminal we start with the git bash.

NODE REPL:
READ
EVAL
PRINT
LOOP
Is an environment where user inputs are read and evaluated and then the results are returned to the user. For example, if I input on node 8+5 node will return 13 to me.


NATIVE MODULES - Starting toolset, a bunch of features already included on node, like reading or writing on file, networking, etc...
In order to use the modules we can require the modules from node.

NPM - Is the place where we can find everything we need to use Node. Is a community tool library, we can access code for Node from anyone. 
Is open source and we can search for any tool that other user have created. 
We can initialize NPM module with init npm command
This will create our configuration file that will be used to install npm packages on our projects.

CSJ - Common JS, use the require keyword
ESM - Echn Script modules, is a standard way to use JS on the backend and frontend, so uses the import keyword, instead of require. 
    -To use ESM we need to include the "type: module" in our Node configuration file.

Framework are a collection of libraries containing codes, it's like a advanced tool that uses "pre-set" code to simplify the developer life.

To create a server:
First thing we need to do is NPM init, to install the package. ( Remember to change the type to module)
I'll create the server with npm i express ( This installs the express framework )
Server request vocab consists in:
Get - request resource
Post - Sending resource
Put and Patch - Update methods, put is when you want to replace the resource, and patch is used to patch up a resource
Delete - is a request that there is something that needs to be deleted

Request comes from the client side, response comes from server side. 

NODEMON - auto update the servers and auto monitor the server changes

POSTMAN - Used for testing requests. 

Express Middleware - a function that will have all the access for requesting an object, responding to an object, and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle.
We got pre-processing, authentication, error handling, logging types.
    Morgan - Logs the requests with information 

Custom middleware - To create a custom middleware we will use the same syntax, app.use((req, res, next) =>{our function() and next()}) the next() ensures that the program goes to the next part of the code.

The order of the middleware is important.

res.sendfile follows an exact path. We need to figure out the direct name, we can do this by importing dirname from path and fileURLtoPath from url packages.
